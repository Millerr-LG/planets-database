Overview
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn represent both inner and outer planets of the Solar System. Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun, with extreme temperature variations due to its lack of atmosphere. Venus, similar in size to Earth, has a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere that creates intense greenhouse heating. Earth is the only known planet to support life, thanks to its liquid water and stable atmosphere. Jupiter, the largest planet, is a gas giant with a strong magnetic field and many moons, while Saturn is another gas giant best known for its prominent ring system and numerous satellites.
